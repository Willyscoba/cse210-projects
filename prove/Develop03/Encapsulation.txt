Encapsulation is the process of enveloping something, as if it were in a container.
it is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that refers to the grouping of data and  the methods that operate on that data into a single class.
The key idea behind encapsulation is to hide the internal state and implementation details of an object from the outside world and to only expose the necessary
functionality through well defined interfaces. This allows for better control over how data is accessed and modified, enhencing the maintainability of the code.
In encapsulation, the internal state of an object is totally kept private.

Benefits of Encapsulation:
1. Information Hiding: Encapsulation hides the internal details of an object's implementation from the outside world. By restricting direct access to an object's data,
encapsulation prevents unauthorized manipulation , reducingmthe risk of bugs and making it easier to maintain and evolve the cde over time.
2. Data integrity: encapsulation provides contol access to data through the methods called 'Getters and Setters', it allows for enforcing constrains and validations of
on data manipulation.
3. Modularity: Encapsulation promots modularity by grouping related data and functions together within a class. this makes it easier to organize and maintain code,
as changes to one part of the code are less likely to have unintended consequences on other parts.
4. Abstraction: Encapsulation allows developers to create abstract data types that pevent real-world entities, hiding the complexity of their implementation.
